# SWAutoPlay

## Features

You can run several dongeons and other features such as :
- Giant B10
- Drake B10
- Necropolis B10
- Scenario
- ToA normal and hard
- Daily reward (coming soon)

## Use

You can run this project with Android Studio updating `SWAutoPlay/app/build.gradle` defaultConfig/testInstrumentationRunnerArgument fields, but that's a tedious way to use this application. A graphical interface is provided to make it easier to use and is called [SWAutoPlay_GUI](https://github.com/JulienCHATEAU/SWAutoPlay_GUI)
